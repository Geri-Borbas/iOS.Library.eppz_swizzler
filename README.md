#### Install

Recommended using CocoaPods.
```
pod 'eppz!swizzler', '~> 0.1.1'
```

Or just grab [`EPPZSwizzler.h`](https://github.com/eppz/eppz.swizzler/blob/master/eppz!swizzler/EPPZSwizzler.h) and [`EPPZSwizzler.m`](https://github.com/eppz/eppz.swizzler/blob/master/eppz!swizzler/EPPZSwizzler.m) into your project, which takes more time actually.
